# Heltec board definitions

## For Arduino board manager

This repository holds the board definitions files for two Heltec boards, the "ESP32 LoRa v3" and the "Wireless Stick v3". It is means as a companion to my [Unofficial Arduino library](https://github.com/ropg/heltec_esp32_lora_v3) for these boards. Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/ropg/heltec_esp32_lora_v3/blob/main/README.md) over there for details.
